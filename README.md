<h2><b><p align="center">Life Quote Guessing Game - featuring onscreen keyboard</p></b></h2>

The OO Phrase Hunter Guessing Game features the following criteria;

1. Includes constructor that receives a phrase parameter and initializes a phrase property set to the phrase.
2. Includes addPhraseToDisplay() method which adds the phrase to the gameboard
3. Includes checkLetter() method which checks if a letter is in the phrase
4. Includes showMatchedLetter() method which reveals the letter(s) on the board that matches the player's selection
5. Includes a constructor that initializes a missed property set to 0, a phrases property set to an array of five Phrase objects, and an activePhrase property set to null initially
6. Phrases added to the game only include letters and spaces
7. Includes startGame() method that hides the start screen overlay, sets the activePhrase property to a random phrase, and calls the addPhraseToDisplay() method on the active phrase
8. Includes getRandomPhrase() method that randomly retrieves one phrase from the phrases array
9. Includes handleInteraction() method that:
      Disables the selected letter's onscreen keyboard button
      If the phrase does not include the guessed letter, the wrong CSS class is added to the selected letter's keyboard button and the removeLife() method is called
      If the phrase includes the guessed letter, the chosen CSS class is added to the selected letter's keyboard button, the showMatchedLetter() method is called on the phrase, and the checkForWin() method is called. If the player has won the game, the gameOver() method is called
      Includes checkForWin() method that checks if the player has revealed all of the letters in the active phrase
      Includes a removeLife() method that removes a life from the scoreboard (one of the liveHeart.png images is replaced with a lostHeart.png image), increments the missed property, and if the player has lost the game calls the gameOver() method
      Includes gameOver() method that displays a final "win" or "loss" message by showing the original start screen overlay styled with either the win or lose CSS class
10. Clicking the "Start Game" button creates a new Game object and starts the game
11. Clicking an onscreen keyboard button results in a call to the handleInteraction() method for the clicked keyboard button
12. Clicking the spaces between and around the onscreen keyboard buttons does not result in the handleInteraction() method being called
13. After a game is completed, the gameboard is reset so that clicking the "Start Game" button loads a new game
